    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "The video game industry began in the 1950s as simple games and simulations. Pixelated screens and limited sound has become a distant memory as video games are offering photorealistic graphics and pushing the frontier of stimulational reality. Video games have become one of the largest sectors in the entertainment market. With the fast growing market, the gaming industry requires marketing data to help predict the sales for their new games. However, in recent years, the emergence of social networks and the developments of mobile games have greatly impacted traditional video games. Careful marketing planning is crucial when a new game is introduced to the market. Therefore, our research question is to predict the sales in the European market for a new video game given North America and other regional sales. To achieve this, we used a dataset generated by scraping of vgchartz.com. It contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies from 1980 to 2017.\n",
